# Creating visualizations

Once you have created a semantic model containing your data, you can start to create visualizations. There are two types of visualizations that you can create with Power BI: report and dashboard. A report is an interactive and multi-page document that presents the data in your semantic model with graphs and texts. While a dashboard is a single page document that shows a selection of graphs from different Power BI reports, which gives an overview of highlights from different reports. Therefore, a report is created using a semantic model, and a dashboard is created using multiple reports. The coming sections will guide you through the creation of two reports and a dashboard. 


## Power BI Reports
We will create a blank report and auto-create another report in this section.

### Data Engineer Salary Report
Create the first report by using the previously created semantic model. Choose a blank report:

</a>

You will then see the report editor where you can continue to work on your report. You also need to save your report to your workspace:

  <img src="https://github.com/kokchun/assets/blob/main/data_visualization_powerbi/report_editor.png?raw=true" alt="powerbi setup" width="600">
</a>

Start by creating some layouts of your report, like creating two pages and using shapes to create a title:

  <img src="https://github.com/kokchun/assets/blob/main/data_visualization_powerbi/basic_layout.png?raw=true" alt="powerbi setup" width="600">
</a>

Now, set a gridline by clicking on *View* so that it is easier to place different visuals on the report. Create visuals called *Card*. In each card, you can show the calculated measures as a KPI. Continue to edit the format of the card under the *Visualizations* panel:

</a>

In the second page of the report, *Further Analysis*, we will be using more types of visuals:
- slicer
- stacked column chart
- table
- treemap
  
>[!TIP]
>Check out the reference, *Visuals Overview*, at the bottom of this chapter to create more visuals on your report. Note that when choosing a visual, you need to consider if it represents interesting insights from the data. 

Follow the lecture video to create and format these visuals.Note that we can make use of the slicer called *Company Country/Territory* to zoom into a subset of data engineer records due to the relationship between the *countries* and *salaries* tables created in the semantic model. After creating all visuals, you can also notice that by default, there is cross-filtering between visuals on a report, meaning that by clicking into a data point in one visual will lead of filtering on another visuals as well.

>[!NOTE]
>💡 **Try it yourself** <br>
From this report, can you find out
>- which job titles are most common around the data engineer records in the data?
>- which job titles tends to earn more?

### Auto-created Report
Try to create another report using the same semantic model. But now, instead of creating a blank report, choose *Auto-create report*. Power BI will design a report for you based on its understanding on the data. 

## Power BI Dashboard
We have two reports now in our workspace. The next step is to create a dashboard to show some highlights of both reports. The intention of the dashboard is that readers will look at the dashboard first, then via the dashboard look into a specific report if they are interested to look into more analyses of a certain topic. 

>[!IMPORTANT]
>As mentioned in chapter 3 when we set up Power BI, we are using Power BI Service. Dashboard is not supported in Power BI Desktop at this moment. 

A dashboard can be created easily by pinning visuals that you would like to put into a dashboard from existing reports:

  <img src="https://github.com/kokchun/assets/blob/main/data_visualization_powerbi/pin_visual.png?raw=true" alt="powerbi setup" width="600">
</a>

After pinning a visual, Power BI will prompt you to name a new dashboard and you will find a dashboard in your workspace:
<a href="https://youtu.be/s7hNlgqREt0" target="_blank">
  <img src="https://github.com/kokchun/assets/blob/main/data_visualization_powerbi/dashboard_in_workspace.png?raw=true" alt="powerbi setup" width="600">
</a>

For each of the chosen visuals on the dashboard, you can click on the title of the visual and Power BI will open directly a specific page of a specific report for you to continue checking more visuals for a certain topic:
